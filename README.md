# Voting Game

Some exploratory code for a final project for the AI master course "Computational Social Choice" at the University of Groningen.
The code currently implements the amendment and successive procedures from [BarberÃ  and Salvador (2017)][1].

## Usage

### Creating voting profiles

You can supply a voting profile as a `.csv`, `.txt` or [PrefLib](https://www.preflib.org) [`.soc`](https://www.preflib.org/data/format.php#soc) file.
For the `.csv`, the program expects column headers indicating the voter ids.
Columns indicate the linear order of preferences, e.g. the file

```csv
1, 2, 3
a, b, c
c, a, b
b, c, a
```

represents the profile

```text
1 â”‚ a c b
2 â”‚ b a c
3 â”‚ c b a
```

When using a `.txt` file, the expected format is the following:

```text
1: a c b
2: b a c
3: c b a
```

This represents the same profile as the one in the CSV.

For `.soc` files, the expected format can be found [here](https://www.preflib.org/data/format.php#election-data).

### Running a voting game

To run a sequential voting game, first create a game:

```python
game = Game( type = GameType.AMENDMENT
           , agenda = ['a', 'b', 'c'] 
           , quota = 1
           , profile = Profile.from_txt("profile.txt")
           )
```

Then, compute the outcome:

```python
outcome = game.outcome()
```

### Analysing a voting game

To analyse a voting game, create an `Analysis` object:

```python
profile = Profile.from_soc("profile.soc")

# You can optionally supply an expected winner
expected_outcome = profile.winner(Rule.BORDA)

analysis = Analysis( type = GameType.AMENDMENT
                   , profile = profile
                   , quota = 2
                   , expected_outcome = expected_outcome
                   )
```

Then, find all possible outcomes:

```python
outcomes = analysis.outcomes()
```

If an expected outcome was specified, this will also print how often that outcome occurred. This can be seen as an indication of the manipulability of a game type in some situations: if the expected winner is often different from the winner of the game, then the agenda has a large influence on the outcome. Similarly, if there are many different outcomes for some game, this also indicates the game type could be manipulable.

**ðŸš¨ WARNING ðŸš¨** When analysing profiles with many alternatives, the number of possible agendas grows _really_ fast:
The number of possible agendas, i.e. all permutations of the alternatives, is the factorial of the number of alternatives.
This program uses some multiprocessing tricks to try to speed up the calculation<sup>1</sup>, but running the analysis on more than ~10 alternatives (depending on your hardware) is not advised.
On my pc, analysing a profile with 9 alternatives with the successive procedure takes around 3 minutes (before multiprocessing: 13 minutes).
**Note**: This seems to run into deadlocks sometimes.
If the code runs for longer than you expect (and you probably shouldn't expect anything over 10 minutes if you're using a â€˜reasonableâ€™ number of alternatives), just kill the program.

### Running experiments

(Still need to write documentation for this. See `main.py` for some details)

<sup><sup>1</sup>Throwing the problem more processes is not an ideal solution, of course, and there are likely many more elegant solutions to improve performance.</sup>
